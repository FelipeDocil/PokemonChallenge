## Welcome!
On the folders:

- `VIPER`: Architecture: VIPER, Persistence: CoreData, UI: Programatically
- _`Realm`: Architecture: VIPER, Persistence: Realm, UI: Programatically_ (**WIP**)
- _`Combine`: Architecture: MVVM (Combine), Persistence: CoreData, UI: SwiftUI_ (Planned)

### Commom

- Functionalities: Sharing the same Gherkin files
- UI: All of them has a list of Pokemon and a detail screen showing their Pokedex entries.
- Network: Using the API, https://pokeapi.co/

### Why

The initial though of doing a project like that was to learn more about VIPER, which is an architecture that I like.

Then it was more of a template for personal projects, a code that I could use as a starting point, since the Network and Database services is easily enough to change if I need it.

My future for this repo is still uses it to learn (e.g. create another project using Combine + SwiftUI this time), improve some knowledges that I already have (e.g. using Realm as a database). And also create some easy templates that I could use for futures projects.

##### Maybe
I'll create another project using Storyboard instead of programmatically UI, but this will always be my lowest priority
